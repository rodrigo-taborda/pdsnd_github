### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, we will use Python to explore data related to bike sharing systems in three major US cities: Chicago, New York and Washington. Using Python code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by calculating descriptive statistics. A script will also be written to take raw data to create an interactive experience on the terminal to present these statistics.
The idea of the project is to give a clearer perspective to users on the use of bicycles in 3 different cities in the country, so they can make a better decision.
